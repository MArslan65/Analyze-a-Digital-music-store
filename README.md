# Analyze a Digital music store database and Optimize the business Strategies
 This project is about analyzing a digital music store database that holds information about the store's media, employees and customers. By querying the database and exploring the data we gain an understanding of the type of music purchased, where customers live and how the company can optimize their business practices. The data set contains information on artists, albums, playlists, tracks and genre and business information such as customer, employee and invoices.
